Django app containing the data, model, and logic for the spatiotemporal province data. 
Pshapes is the final product that users can download or view on the main page.
Pshapes is created by starting with any modern-day spatial province dataset, and then 
reverse georeferencing earlier provinces based on the 'pchanges' data entries. 
The 'pshapes' github repository contains a process.py script that can be used to create
a final pshapes geojson file. Once quality checked, this geojson file must then be
inserted into the 'pshapes' table in the heroku pshapes_site database.
